### Introduction

One of the things I've noticed in my time working with Google Sheets is that there aren't many good alternatives to Ben L. Collins's tutorials. While I've heard nothing but good things about them, I've noticed that they do not cover a number of topics that I believe are critical to high-level formulae. I therefore propose a curriculum intended to fill the gap between intermediate and advanced formula usage.
### A Useless Skill

To start, I want to be clearâ€”I believe that there is no effective use for spreadsheet formulae beyond a certain threshold. The justification of this curriculum cannot be utility; rather, the motive should be for other reasons. For me, that motive is fun. I do believe there's a fundamental gap between realistic proficiency (i.e. the skill to operate in help forums) and the level available in tutorials that can be productively addressed. However, the curriculum I propose goes beyond that, for no reason other than that I think it would be fun.
